# MetalNES
Transistor level NES-001 simulation. Builds on OSX only for now. No MMU support.

Only possible due to the tremendous efforts of [Visual2C02](https://wiki.nesdev.org/w/index.php/Visual_2C02) and [Visual2A03](http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/chipimages/visual2a03/). 

Added support chips for main board. Needs lots of optimization.
